In this homework, the users can click the list item or use swipe action "View" to the Information Page. Then, if they click anywhere inside the view, the view will be flipped and be transferred into the animation page.
First of all, at the top and the bottom of this view, there are two attributed string showing the property of underlining, font, color and special handling of characters.
Then, closely below the top string is the music button, which can play a beautiful song and will close automatically when the view is flipped.
Next, the following two "Z" characters are drawn with geometryreader through path. I just pick up all the points for connection, add it to the path and make it show up. Meanwhile, the fading in and out animation is carried out here to make it more harmonic with the sound sleep background.
Finally, in the very middle of the view, it is a clock starting from the date of current time and continuely tracing the time in the real life.

For extra points, the flipping animation is realized by shifting 180 degree from one side to another. Music is achieved. And attributed string has been implemented more than just modifying the normal property. Different animations can be helpful for credits but I personally don't count for it very much.
